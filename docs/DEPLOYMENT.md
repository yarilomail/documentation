# Deployment

Deployment topology, sizing, and high availability. This is a design-level
reference; for step-by-step setup see the
[Installation Guide](./INSTALL).

## Architecture model

yarilo is a Go application that uses **goroutines** for concurrency, not fork-per-user as in
The reference C. A single process (e.g. `yarilo-imap`) serves N user sessions through goroutines
(~100 KB per session).

**Multi-binary, multi-process** (per CLAUDE.md):
- 4 separate binaries in the session role: `yarilo-imap`, `yarilo-pop3`, `yarilo-submission`, `yarilo-lmtp`
- 4 separate binaries in the proxy role (director): `yarilo-imap-login`, `yarilo-pop3-login`, `yarilo-submission-login`, `yarilo-lmtp-login`
- Each is a distinct process with its own address space
- Coordination between session processes within a backend deployment goes through `yarilo-locks`

Goroutines vs fork:
- 1000 users in a single pod ≈ 200–500 MB RAM, not 10 GB
- No "fat pod" problem
- Horizontal scaling is for HA, not for resource limits

## Components

### director deployment
Routes user connections to backends through a **consistent-hashing ring**.
Contains: 5 proxy processes (`yarilo-imap-login`, `yarilo-pop3-login`, `yarilo-submission-login`, `yarilo-lmtp-login`, `yarilo-jmap-login`), 3 director processes, self-organizing ring (#750).
This is where **TLS terminate + passdb auth + allow_nets enforcement** happens.

`yarilo-jmap-login` carries the same duties over HTTP; the flow below describes
the byte-pipe protocols, and [JMAP — the HTTP frontend/backend split](#jmap--the-http-frontendbackend-split)
describes where it differs.

**Login pod auth flow:**
1. Accept TLS connection from client.
2. Extract real client IP from HAProxy PROXY protocol header or raw TCP RemoteAddr.
3. Parse the IMAP/POP3/SMTP AUTHENTICATE or LOGIN command to obtain credentials.
4. Call **yarilo-auth** (`AUTH` command) — passdb chain runs there; receives `token=` on success.
   `allow_nets` and `nologin` are enforced in the login pod using the real client IP.
5. On failure: send `NO Invalid credentials` to the client. Backend is never contacted.
6. On success: send proto-specific auth OK to the client, then dial the backend and send:
   ```
   YARILO\tADDR=<real-client-ip>\tSESSION=<warden-id>\tUSER=<username>\tTOKEN=<64hex>\n
   ```
7. Backend reads the preamble, calls yarilo-auth `VERIFY token` to confirm the session,
   and enters pre-authenticated state. No passdb round-trip on the backend side.

### backend deployment (one per tag = one per NFS shard)
Handles authenticated mail sessions, reading and writing mail + index data to NFS.

**Co-located pod (one pod serves ALL of a user's per-user state).** A backend pod
is a **single StatefulSet** whose pod runs one container per protocol —
`yarilo-imap`, `yarilo-pop3`, `yarilo-submission`, `yarilo-lmtp`,
`yarilo-managesieve`, `yarilo-jmap` — plus the `yarilo-fts` full-text-search container, the
`yarilo-backend-api` admin container, and a `yarilo-backend-reg` registration
sidecar, sharing the pod's **one IP** and the tag's **one NFS PV (RWX)**.
`yarilo-locks` runs as its own per-tag Deployment for cross-pod write
coordination.

**What goes in the pod vs stays separate — the criterion.** The pod holds
everything that owns **per-user write state**: the protocol containers, `fts`
(per-user Xapian index), and `backend-api` (its `fts rescan`/`optimize` and
direct mailbox/index access write a user's data — as a standalone Deployment it
would be a *second* writer of the same index/mailbox the user's sticky pod owns,
the #675/#676 hazard; in-pod it uses that pod's localhost fts, so single-writer
holds). `backend-api` listens on the **pod IP only**; `yarctl` reaches the
owning pod by doing a director LOOKUP itself and dialing that pod (#792).
**Global-read services with stable external consumers stay separate** —
`yarilo-quota-status` is a Postfix policy service the external MTA dials at a
fixed endpoint, and it only reads a shared quota dict (any instance answers any
user, no per-user write), so co-locating it would break the MTA contract for
zero gain. It stays its own Deployment.

This is deliberate and load-bearing for the whole director model: it restores the
The reference invariant **one mail-host owns every per-user resource**. Because the pod
at a given IP answers imap *and* pop3 *and* lmtp *and* submission *and*
managesieve, the director needs only **one ring and one user→pod map** — a user
hashes to one pod IP, and that IP is correct for every protocol (the login proxy
dials the protocol-specific port on that same IP). See "Director routing — one
ring" and "Why co-located, not per-protocol StatefulSets" below.

**FTS is co-located for the same reason — and it closes #675/#676.** The Xapian
index is **per-user**, and a session reaches FTS over `ftsproto`. Today
`fts.fts_addr` is a shared ClusterIP, so requests for one user's index
round-robin across `yarilo-fts` replicas → two pods cache the same user's write
handle → corruption (why `replicas > 1` is a footgun, #676; the write-handle
hand-off #675). Co-locating `yarilo-fts` in the pod with `fts_addr = localhost`
makes the user's **already-sticky** pod the sole owner of that user's index write
handle. On the shared NFS every per-user Xapian dir then has exactly one writer —
the same "1 user = 1 pod" invariant that fixes #788 gives FTS single-writer for
free, so `replicas > N` is safe (indexing load follows the users on each pod).

Declare the storage in the chart: `fts.fts_storage_type: "nfs"` for every
backend tag (the shards live on the tag's RWX PV), `"local"` for a standalone
on a local PV. It is a declaration, not a detection, and it decides where a
durability call is real — see the setting's own note in `helm/values.yaml`.

::: warning The NFS export must be `sync`
This is a server setting no code path can compensate for. NFSv3/v4 require
metadata operations (`RENAME`, `REMOVE`, `RMDIR`) to be committed to stable
storage before the reply, and every atomic write in yarilo — index and cache
tmp+rename, maildir delivery, FTS shard compaction — rests on that. An `async`
export answers before committing, so a crash can lose a rename the client was
told had succeeded; a client-side `fsync` cannot repair it (there is no
commit-a-directory operation, and `fsync` on a directory is a no-op over NFS).
The cost of `async` is paid in silently rolled-back metadata, not in a visible
error (#1176).
:::

**Login proxies are not needed inside the backend** — it accepts plain TCP from the director
with auth state in the YARILO preamble. The login pods (`yarilo-imap-login`, …,
`yarilo-sasl-login`) live in the **director deployment** (see
`/yarilo_director.svg`), never here.

Backend auth logic:
- Login pod sends `YARILO\tADDR=...\tSESSION=...\tUSER=...\tTOKEN=...\n` before any protocol exchange.
- Backend's `PreambleListener` reads the preamble, calls yarilo-auth VERIFY (`service=` field enforced), enters pre-authenticated state.
- All 4 backends accept only the YARILO preamble from login pods (director is control-plane only — it never touches client bytes; #741). Client-IP forwarding into the *login* layer, when needed, is haproxy protocol / native inbound (ID/XCLIENT, #742) / none, chosen per protocol — it never reaches the backend directly. LMTP preamble originates from `yarilo-lmtp-login`.

### backend liveness — self-registration + heartbeat (#776)

Backends are registered in the director ring by **self-registration + heartbeat**,
not by a one-time DNS resolve or an external prober. This makes the backend list a
second application of the exact lifecycle machinery already built for the director
ring itself (JOIN on start, ring-wide keepalive, graceful leave #770, Lamport
ordering #772, tombstone-free convergence) rather than a separate DNS-poll
mechanism — and it works in **every** topology (k8s and non-k8s standalone),
consistent with config-not-binary. Supersedes the DNS-reconcile approach (closed
PR #778).

**One registration per POD, not per protocol.** Because the pod is co-located,
exactly **one** `yarilo-backend-reg` sidecar per pod owns the director
registration — it registers the **pod IP once**, not one stream per protocol
container. This is not cosmetic: four protocol containers each registering the
same IP would push four independent monotonic-seq streams for one origin, and the
strictly-newer lease dedup (#776) compares seq only within an origin — four
interleaved streams on one IP would fight, each rejecting the others as stale. One
sidecar = one origin = one clean seq stream. The sidecar reuses the exact
`internal/backendreg` client (including the #787 fixes: PONG on the director's
PING, and reconnect-backoff reset on a healthy long-lived connection — without
those a co-located pod would flap **as a whole**, a larger blast radius than the
per-protocol flap #787 first surfaced).

Model:
- **Register on start.** The `yarilo-backend-reg` sidecar dials the director
  **ClusterIP Service** — it does not matter which director replica answers; a
  load-balanced address is correct here precisely because the registration is
  gossiped **ring-wide**. It sends `BACKEND-UP\t{ip}\t{port}\t{tag}\t{vhosts}\t{seq}`
  for the **pod IP**; the receiving director adds it and forwards it as a
  `RING-CHANGE up` envelope (carrying port + vhosts, #776) so every director learns
  it. `{port}` is nominal — login proxies override it with their own protocol port
  (`internal/login` BackendPort / lmtp-login BackendPort), dialing
  `{pod-ip}:{protocol-port}`; the ring entry identifies the POD, the login picks the
  protocol port. (This is the only backend→director control channel — otherwise the
  director only ever dials backends.)
- **`{tag}` is the STORAGE SHARD, never the protocol.** A co-located pod serves all
  protocols, so protocol is not a routing dimension — the tag stays a pure NFS-shard
  label (one tag = one NFS PV = one `yarilo-backend` release). Per-user shard
  selection (userdb `director_tag`, #746) is unaffected.
- **Heartbeat = periodic re-register, gated on the PROTOCOL containers'
  self-health.** Every `register_interval` seconds (Helm: `backend_register.register_interval`) the sidecar re-sends
  `BACKEND-UP` — but ONLY while **every protocol** container in the pod is serving
  (each protocol's `/readyz`: listener accepting and not wedged). A heartbeat must
  prove the DATA PATH is alive, not merely that a control goroutine still ticks.
  **Readiness-gate semantics (spell this out for operators):** because it is one
  pod = one ring entry, a *single* unready protocol container makes the whole pod
  go silent → the lease expires → the pod is removed for **all** protocols. This is
  correct and matches the reference (host down = down for everything on that host), but it
  is a real coupling: an NFS-wedged `yarilo-lmtp` will pull the pod's IMAP traffic
  off too. That is the price of the one-mail-host invariant, and the sidecar's gate
  makes the wedge fail safe (silence → expiry) rather than routing to a half-dead
  pod. **`yarilo-fts` is deliberately NOT in the gate:** FTS is best-effort (a
  wedged index degrades SEARCH to a slow fallback but never blocks mail flow), so
  an unhealthy fts container must not evict the pod's live IMAP/LMTP traffic. Each heartbeat
  carries a **monotonic per-origin sequence** (a logical counter, NOT wall-clock —
  the Lamport lesson of #772: pod clocks are unsynchronized, so freshness is
  compared only *within* one backend's own origin; the seq is seeded from the
  process start time so a same-IP restart resumes above the director's last-recorded
  seq, #776), gossiped ring-wide as "backend X seen at seq N". Every director keeps
  the max seen per backend; a heartbeat landing on **any** director refreshes the
  lease everywhere — this is what makes a load-balanced heartbeat correct (a
  per-director timer with LB'd heartbeats would false-expire a live backend on the
  directors that happened not to receive it).
- **TTL expiry → LEAVE (remove + rehash).** A backend whose last-seen has not
  advanced within `backend_expire` on the ring is REMOVED (`RING-CHANGE down` →
  `RemoveBackend` everywhere); its hash-slice rehashes onto neighbouring backends
  in the same tag. This covers the silent hang / crash with no external prober.
- **Graceful leave → LEAVE (remove + rehash).** On SIGTERM the backend sends
  `BACKEND-DOWN` (analog of the director's #770 graceful leave) so it is removed
  immediately without waiting out the TTL — a planned rollout / scale-down never
  blackholes a hash-slice for the expiry window.
- **Overload → FLUSH (drain, NO rehash), never DOWN.** Removal and overload are
  DIFFERENT wire events with different consequences and must not be conflated. A
  backend shedding load sends `BACKEND-FLUSH`: it STAYS in the ring, new LOOKUPs
  stop landing on it, existing sessions keep running — its hash-slice does NOT
  move. A transient load spike therefore causes zero user reshuffling. Sending
  `BACKEND-DOWN` on overload would remove it → rehash the slice away → and then a
  second rehash back when it re-registers a minute later: double-shuffling users
  through a transient peak, worse than the peak itself. This matches the reference's
  down/vhosts semantics (drain by zeroing vhosts, not by removal). `BACKEND-DOWN`
  is reserved for genuine LEAVE (SIGTERM / expiry).

Safety + migration:
- **Never remove the last backend of a tag** by TTL expiry — a suspect-but-only
  backend is kept (and logged loudly) rather than guaranteeing a total blackhole
  for that tag.
- **Static `mail_servers` entries stay non-expiring** — they are a bootstrap /
  non-k8s fallback and are never pruned by the heartbeat lease, so registration can
  be rolled out incrementally with no binary branching (config-not-binary).
- **admin-API `backends add/remove` stay manual and non-expiring** — an operator's
  explicit entry is never touched by the lease.
- **No tombstone needed** (unlike ring members whose ephemeral pod identity never
  returns): a dead backend heartbeats nowhere and never re-registers, so a gossiped
  ghost simply ages out at TTL.

Config (snake_case, section-prefixed; `yarilo.yaml` + Helm `values.yaml`):
- `director_service.backend_expire` — seconds of missed heartbeat before a backend
  is removed ring-wide.
- sidecar side: `backend_register.director_addr` (director ClusterIP),
  `backend_register.register_interval`, `backend_register.tag` (NFS shard),
  `backend_register.vhosts`. One `backend_register` block per pod drives the single
  `yarilo-backend-reg` sidecar; there is **no** per-protocol registration path
  (config-not-binary: one registration mechanism, no modes).

### backend process liveness — the watchdog probe (#904)

Distinct from ring registration above: that governs whether a backend is a
routing target, this governs whether a wedged container is **restarted**.

The three probes on each co-located protocol container answer three different
questions, and only one of them can restart the container:

- **startupProbe** — dependencies (locks, Redis, DB) are reachable before the
  container takes traffic (#903). Runs once at start.
- **readinessProbe** — the pod's per-protocol freshness file is fresh (#788), so
  the login proxy only routes to a container that is currently serving. Removes
  from endpoints, never restarts.
- **livenessProbe** — `/healthz`, which is unconditional until the **liveness
  watchdog** trips it. The watchdog is a timer-driven self-check (stat the mail
  store base, enter a local gate) that fails `/healthz` when the request path is
  wedged in a way nothing else sees: a stale NFS handle hanging every mailbox op,
  or an in-process deadlock, while the accept loop and this HTTP server keep
  answering. Restarting is then the only correct response, and liveness is the
  only probe that restarts.

**Why liveness is gated on the watchdog.** Without a self-check, `/healthz`
answers 200 as long as the telemetry server runs, so a liveness probe on it is
inert — it can only ever catch the telemetry server itself dying, which the
process's own `os.Exit(1)` on a dead accept loop already covers. So the backend
carried no livenessProbe historically. The probe is therefore rendered **only
when `telemetry.livenessWatchdog.enabled`** is set: enabling the watchdog is what
makes `/healthz` a real signal, and only then does watching it with a restart
make sense. Off by default preserves the prior no-restart behaviour exactly.

**Guard rails against restarting a healthy busy pod:** the watchdog trips only
after several consecutive failed self-checks, the self-check timeout is shorter
than its interval, the probe has its own `failureThreshold` on top, and the
self-check touches **nothing shared** — so a hung NFS handle restarts the one pod
that mounts it, and a database hiccup restarts nothing. A single protocol
container restarts alone; the other protocols on the pod keep serving.

Config (snake_case, section-prefixed; `yarilo.yaml` + Helm `values.yaml`):
`telemetry.liveness_watchdog.liveness_watchdog_enabled` / `_interval_seconds` /
`_timeout_seconds` / `_failure_threshold`, and `_fault_injection_enabled` — a
self-destruct switch that exposes `POST /debug/fault/deadlock` to confirm the
restart path on a live pod, off by default.

### Profiling a live pod

The Go runtime profilers are served on the telemetry port, and are **off by
default**. They answer questions no metric can: which function a saturated
worker is actually in, where a component's allocations come from, and why
adding CPU makes a stage slower rather than faster.

One switch:

| Value | Serves | Contains |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `telemetry.pprof.enabled` | `/debug/pprof/profile`, `trace`, `allocs`, `heap`, `goroutine`, `block`, `mutex`, `threadcreate`, `cmdline`, `symbol` | stacks, counts and symbol names — which code paths this process runs and what they cost |

`block` and `mutex` are in that list but stay silent until a sampling rate is
set; see below.

**What a profile does not contain is the contents of anything.** A pprof profile
is a set of sampled stack traces with object and byte counts attached; the format
has no field a message body or a credential could appear in. What it does give
away is the shape of the workload — which paths run, how often, how much they
allocate — and the symbol names of the binary. That is worth something to
someone, which is why the switch is off by default and why every component logs
a warning at each start while it is on.

`telemetry.pprof.heapEnabled` was a second switch, on the grounds that the heap
route dumped live objects while the rest were only stacks and counts. It is
**deprecated and does nothing**; a process that finds it set says so at start.
Go's `heap` and `allocs` are the same profile with different default sample
types, so the allocation route always served `inuse_space` as well — the switch
withheld nothing.

Asking what is *retained* rather than what was allocated is a matter of the
sample type, not the route:

```sh
go tool pprof -inuse_space http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/allocs
```

There is no `/debug/pprof/` index page. It dispatches any path under it to the
runtime profile of that name, so the set of routes would be decided by whatever
any package in the binary registered with `runtime/pprof` rather than by the
list above.

While either switch is on, every component logs a warning **at every start**
naming what is exposed. That is deliberate — the failure this guards against is
not enabling profiling, it is enabling it for an afternoon's investigation and
leaving it on for a year.

### Profiles that need a sampling rate

`/debug/pprof/block` and `/debug/pprof/mutex` are served by the switch above,
but they answer with an **empty profile** until sampling is turned on — a
diagnostic that returns 200 and says nothing. Two more values do that:

| Value | Default | Sets |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `telemetry.pprof.blockProfileRate` | `0` (off) | one sample per this many nanoseconds of blocked time |
| `telemetry.pprof.mutexProfileFraction` | `0` (off) | one sample per this many mutex contention events |

They are separate from `enabled` because serving a route and collecting samples
are different costs. The route is free while nobody fetches it; the sampling is
paid by **every blocking operation and every contended mutex in the process**,
whether or not anyone ever takes the profile.

This is the instrument for time spent *waiting* — a CPU profile cannot see it,
because a goroutine asleep on a lock or a socket burns nothing. Turn the rates
on for the measurement window, take the capture, set them back to `0`:

```yaml
telemetry:
  pprof:
    enabled: true
    blockProfileRate: 10000      # ns of blocked time per sample
    mutexProfileFraction: 100    # one in N contention events
```

```sh
go tool pprof -http=: http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/block
```

Both rates warn at every start while they are on, for the same reason the
switches above do.

Taking a profile, with the telemetry port reachable only inside the cluster:

```sh
kubectl -n <ns> port-forward pod/<pod> 8080:<telemetry-port>

# 30 seconds of CPU, which is what identifies a hot stage
go tool pprof -http=: "http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=30"

# where allocations are made, and -inuse_space for what is still held
go tool pprof -http=: http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/allocs
```

The telemetry port differs per container in the co-located backend pod — each
is told its own via `TELEMETRY_LISTEN` — so take it from the container's
`ports:` rather than assuming `8080`.

### JMAP — the HTTP frontend/backend split

JMAP is HTTP, so the layers split the same way as every other protocol but the
hop between them is **per-request HTTP proxying rather than a TCP byte pipe**.
That is the only difference, and it is what removes the need for fd-passing: a
JMAP client carries its credentials on every request, so there is no session
pinned to a connection to hand over.

| Duty | `yarilo-jmap-login` | `yarilo-jmap` |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Client TLS (`general.ssl`), HAProxy PROXY protocol | terminates | no knowledge of client TLS |
| `Authorization` Basic/Bearer → yarilo-auth passdb chain | yes | accepts identity only from the login layer |
| warden: auth-failure penalty, per-user@IP accounting, kick bus | yes | no |
| director lookup → proxy to the user's backend pod | yes | — |
| Storage via `pkg/mailbox`, session object, JMAP methods | no | yes |

**The internal hop.** After auth, `yarilo-jmap-login` resolves the user through
the director and proxies the request to that pod's `yarilo-jmap` over **internal
mTLS**, carrying `X-Session-ID`, `X-Proxy-TTL` and `Forwarded` (RFC 7239). The
exact header contract lives in INTERNALS.md; `Forwarded` is the HTTP-native
equivalent of XCLIENT, giving the backend the real client IP and TLS state for
logging and warden attribution. `allow_nets` is enforced in the login pod
against the real client before proxying, as for every other protocol — one
enforcement point, not two.

**Trust boundary.** Identity travels in headers, so a request carrying
`X-Session-ID` or `Forwarded` is honoured only from a peer the backend has been
told to trust. Three modes, all default-deny — there is no branch in which an
unknown peer is believed:

| Anchor | Who may set identity headers |
|:---|:---|
| `internal_tls.enabled: true` | only the login layer's client certificate. The k8s mode. |
| mTLS off, `general.xclient.trusted_nets` covers the peer | only peers inside those CIDRs. The same key that already gates XCLIENT and `IMAP ID x-originating-ip`: `Forwarded` is the HTTP member of that family, not a new concept. Enabled per listener with `services.jmap.xclient_protocol`, as elsewhere. |
| neither | nobody: identity requests answer `403`, and startup logs that no trust anchor is configured. |

The third case keeps the listener up on purpose. A dead port reads as a network
fault and sends the operator to the wrong place; a live port answering `403`
with a named cause diagnoses itself, and `/healthz` and `/readyz` keep working
instead of the pod entering CrashLoop.

The compose standalone has no certificate infrastructure by design — one host,
a private docker network — so it adds its docker subnet to
`general.xclient.trusted_nets` in the shipped config. The stock default is
`127.0.0.1/32, 10.0.0.0/8`, which does not cover the usual docker bridge, so
this stays an explicit entry rather than an assumption.

**`connection_limit` means warden.** On this listener the knob has the same
meaning as everywhere else: per-user/IP accounting held in warden, shared across
replicas. A local socket cap may exist as a process backstop, but it is a
different thing and is not published under this name.

**Scaling.** `yarilo-jmap-login` is stateless beyond TLS and scales on request
load in both shapes. `yarilo-jmap` scales differently per shape, for the same
reason every other session process does: behind a director it is a container in
the co-located pod and scales with it, because it reads the same per-user index
and mailbox as that pod's other protocol containers and must not become a second
writer of them; in the standalone shape it is its own Deployment with its own
`replicaCount`, and cross-pod write contention is resolved through
`yarilo-locks` like every other session Deployment there.

**Ports.** Client-facing `:8443` on `yarilo-jmap-login`; the backend listens on
`:10443`, in the same range as the other backend data ports (`10143`, `10110`,
`10587`, `10024`, `14190`) and deliberately clear of `:8080`, which is the
telemetry port every component pod already uses.

### shared services (one deployment per installation)
- `yarilo-auth` — passdb (for the director) + userdb (for everyone)
- `yarilo-warden` — connection/session limits (read + write from both sides)

### Why `yarilo-locks` is per backend rather than shared
- Each backend tag has its **own NFS share** — a separate data scope.
- Locks apply only to files in that share; there is no reason to coordinate with other tags.
- Lower latency (local to the backend pod).
- Blast-radius isolation: a `yarilo-locks` failure in tag A does not affect tag B.
- No global bottleneck.

### Who writes and reads `yarilo-warden`

| Writer | What it writes |
|:---|:---|
| director's login proxies (imap/pop3/submission) | CONNECT/DISCONNECT events (pre-auth connection tracking, per-IP rate limit) |
| `yarilo-lmtp-login` | CONNECT/DISCONNECT per recipient (per-user delivery rate tracking) |
| backend's session processes (imap/pop3/submission) | SESSION_START / SESSION_END (post-auth, active mail sessions) |

| Reader | When and why |
|:---|:---|
| director's login proxies | Before admitting a new connection — enforce per-user/per-IP limits on connections + sessions |
| `yarilo-lmtp-login` | Per RCPT TO — enforce per-user delivery concurrency limits before fan-out |

Warden merges conn-state (from the director / lmtp-login) with session-state (from the backends) — written
from different processes, read from a single place (the login proxy).

### Scaling `yarilo-warden` — 1 → N replicas (#908)

Warden holds three pieces of shared state: the per-IP auth-failure **penalty** counter, the
per-`user@ip` **session** accounting (the connection limit), and the **kick bus** (`EMIT`/`SUBSCRIBE`).
Where that state lives is a single config choice — `components.warden.service.state_backend`:

| `state_backend` | State lives in | Replicas | Deploy strategy |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `memory` (default) | the pod's process | **must be 1** | `Recreate` |
| `redis` | shared Redis | any N | `RollingUpdate` |

- **`memory`** is the standalone / dev / test default. All three pieces of state are per-pod, so a
  second replica would see a *different* subset of sessions, enforce the limit independently, and — the
  decisive one — **miss kicks**: a login pod's `SUBSCRIBE` lands (via the ClusterIP) on one pod while an
  `EMIT` may land on another, and an in-process bus never crosses that gap. The chart therefore **fails
  closed** on `replicas > 1` with `memory`, and the deploy strategy is `Recreate` so a rolling update
  never briefly runs two memory pods and splits their state.
- **`redis`** moves all three pieces into shared Redis: penalty is a key with TTL, sessions are hashes +
  an atomic counter reconciled by a sweep, and the kick bus is Redis **Pub/Sub** — an `EMIT` on any pod
  `PUBLISH`es, and every pod's subscribers receive it, so a kick published on pod-B is delivered by
  pod-A. Pods are then stateless and scale to any N behind the existing ClusterIP; the strategy is a
  normal `RollingUpdate`. This is the required setting before raising `replicas`.

Both the subscribe path (go-redis auto-reconnects and re-subscribes on a Redis blip) and the
login→warden transport (the login pod redials + re-subscribes) recover on their own, so a Redis or warden
restart does not permanently deafen a pod to kicks. Kick delivery is best-effort / at-most-once and is
**not** a correctness guarantee — the director's confirmed ring-wide kill (#847) holds `LOOKUP` until the
ring-wide session count is stably zero, so split-writer safety never depends on a kick landing; the kick
only makes teardown prompt.

Observability for the scale-out (all always-on, no debug flag): `yarilo_warden_connect_total{result}`,
`yarilo_warden_kick_emitted_total` / `yarilo_warden_kick_delivered_total` (different pods, proving
cross-replica delivery under a scrape), `yarilo_warden_redis_errors_total{op}` (fail-open made visible),
`yarilo_warden_reconcile_adjustments_total`, and `yarilo_warden_penalty_updates_total{result}`. Structured
logs carry `pod=` so a kick can be traced across replicas directly.

## yarilo-locks — design

**Purpose:** coordinate writes to mailbox and index files across the four session processes
(`yarilo-imap` / `yarilo-pop3` / `yarilo-submission` / `yarilo-lmtp`) — uniformly across every
deployment shape.

**Why needed:** the four binaries live in distinct address spaces. In-process `sync.Mutex` does
not cross process boundaries. In backend deployments there is the additional dimension of
coordination between StatefulSet replicas within the same tag (notably during failover).

### Deployment modes — one abstraction, two backends

A single `pkg/locks` API and a single wire protocol, with two implementations behind it.
**Production k8s always uses remote mode** (Redis-backed, mTLS TCP), regardless of how many
replicas the deployment runs — this is the only mode that supports horizontal scaling without
a config or code rework. Embedded mode is reserved for non-k8s use only.

| Mode | Production k8s (standalone or backend) | Dev / CI |
|:---|:---|:---|
| When to use | Every k8s Helm release. Scales from 1 → N replicas via `replicaCount` in values.yaml. | Local CLI runs, unit tests, single-process smoke runs. **Never in k8s.** |
| Process | `yarilo-locks` as its own Deployment (typically replicaCount=2 for HA). | `yarilo-locks --embedded` co-located in the same process tree. |
| State backend | Redis (bundled subchart or external). | In-memory map (ephemeral, pod-local). |
| Transport | mTLS TCP `:9104` reached through a ClusterIP Service. | Unix socket `/run/yarilo/locks.sock`. |
| HA | 2+ replicas behind the Service; Redis HA via Sentinel/Cluster. | None — state dies with the process. |
| Scales to N session pods | Yes. All session pods reach the same locks Service and share state via Redis. | No. Unix socket is pod-local and in-memory state is per-process. |
| RTT (typical) | ~1–2 ms (in-cluster Redis on the same node ~0.5 ms). | ~100–300 µs. |
| Wire protocol | identical | identical |

**Why embedded is not a k8s option, even at `replicaCount=1`:**
- Unix-socket coordination is pod-local. Bump `replicaCount: 1 → 2` and the second pod
  cannot see lock state held by the first — two writers collide on the same NFS file.
- A scheduled rolling restart of a single replica drops every in-flight lock for ~30 s.
  Remote mode survives this: clients reconnect to the surviving replica and pick up state
  from Redis.
- Operator surprise is the worst kind of incident. The deployment must not silently switch
  semantics when the operator scales it up. One mode in production, end of story.

**Two-tier locking convention:** `sync.Mutex` inside a process is the fast-path for
goroutine-level contention (no RTT). `yarilo-locks` (always remote, in production) is engaged
only when a cross-process barrier is required (any write to a shared file).

### Configuration

Two independent sections in `yarilo.yaml`. The yarilo-locks process consumes
`locks_service`; every session binary (yarilo-imap, yarilo-pop3, yarilo-submission,
yarilo-lmtp) consumes `locks_client`. mTLS material is shared with the rest of
the stack via `internal_tls` — no separate keys live under the locks sections.

```yaml
# k8s production (standalone or backend): yarilo-locks listens on TCP+mTLS,
# Redis backs the state.
locks_service:
  mode: remote
  listen: ":9104"
  redis: "redis://redis.yarilo.svc.cluster.local:6379/0"

# session binaries reach yarilo-locks via the ClusterIP Service.
locks_client:
  mode: remote
  endpoints: ["yarilo-locks.yarilo.svc.cluster.local:9104"]

internal_tls:
  enabled: true
  cert: /etc/yarilo/tls/tls.crt
  key:  /etc/yarilo/tls/tls.key
  ca:   /etc/yarilo/tls/ca.crt
```

#### Internal client dials — `internal_tls.server_name` (#816)

Every internal **client** dial (auth / warden / locks / backend-api / backend /
fts / the login pods) verifies the peer against a single pinned name,
`internal_tls.server_name` — **not** the dialed host. Internal services are
reached by short name, FQDN, or pod IP interchangeably, so host-based
verification is unreliable; the shared internal-tls cert instead carries one
stable SAN and every client pins it. Because all internal components share one
cert, mutual auth attests **"cluster member"**, not a specific service identity
(true per-service identity would need per-service certs — a separate redesign).

The chart defaults `server_name` to `<release>-internal` and injects that name
into the director cert SANs; **the shared internal-tls secret you provide MUST
carry `<release>-internal` as a SAN** (`hack/internal-ca-sandbox.yaml` shows a
self-signed CA chain that does). `internal_tls.enabled=true` with an empty
`server_name` fails **loudly at startup** (`mtls.ClientConfig` errors with a fix
hint) rather than as a cryptic "ServerName must be specified" on the first dial.
`saslLogin` and `quotaStatus` now also carry an `internalTLS` block/mount — every
component that dials an internal service needs the cert mounted.

The director **ring** dial is separate — see below.

#### Ring mTLS — `director_service.ring_tls_server_name` (#753)

The director dials its ring peers (JOIN, right-neighbor, seed polls) by
**ephemeral pod IP**. Under `internal_tls` the dial verifies the peer's
certificate against `ring_tls_server_name` (a stable name), *not* the pod IP —
without it Go would check the pod IP against the cert's SANs and fail closed, so
the ring would silently never converge. The dial uses a proper client config
(with `RootCAs`); the ring *listener* keeps the mTLS server config.

The chart issues a **director-specific** internal-tls certificate (enable
`components.director.internalTLS.certificate`) whose SANs default to
`<release>-director-ring` and `<release>-director`, and renders
`ring_tls_server_name` to `<release>-director-ring` automatically. The stock
*shared* internal-tls secret has no such SAN — enabling `internal_tls` on the
director with that shared cert fails ring handshakes. On misconfiguration the
director is loud: an **ERROR** when `internal_tls` is on and peers are set but
`ring_tls_server_name` is empty, and a **Warn** when the configured name is
absent from its own loaded certificate.

**Certificate rotation.** cert-manager renews the Secret and kubelet refreshes
the mounted files, but each director loads its `tls.Config` **once at startup** —
a renewed cert is picked up only after a **rolling restart of the director
StatefulSet**. The ring survives a rolling restart normally (verified by the
#770 graceful-leave gates). Lazy in-process reload (`GetClientCertificate`) is a
possible future enhancement, not implemented here.

```yaml
# dev / unit tests / non-k8s CLI runs (single process, no Redis).
locks_service:
  mode: embedded
  socket: /run/yarilo/locks.sock

locks_client:
  mode: embedded
  socket: /run/yarilo/locks.sock
```

### Lock model

- **Exclusive (X) locks only** for writes.
- **Reads take no lock** — the storage layer provides a consistent snapshot.
- TTL-based (auto-release on client crash, typically 30 s with renew every 10 s).
- Granularity: per-mailbox (`mbox:<user>:<folder>`).

| Operation | Lock |
|:---|:---|
| IMAP SELECT / FETCH / SEARCH / IDLE | none |
| LIST / LSUB | none |
| IMAP APPEND / EXPUNGE / STORE | X on mailbox |
| LMTP delivery | X on mailbox |
| Rename / Delete mailbox | X on mailbox |
| Sieve script update | X on user-scripts |

### Wire protocol — identical across both modes

TAB-delimited, LF-terminated. In remote mode the transport is TCP over mTLS on port `:9104`.
In embedded mode the identical byte stream runs over the Unix socket `/run/yarilo/locks.sock`
(no TLS).

```
> VERSION\t1\n
< VERSION\t1\tOK\n

> LOCK\t<resource>\t<owner>\t<ttl_ms>\n
< OK\t<lock_id>\n           # acquired
< BUSY\t<current_owner>\n   # held by someone else

> UNLOCK\t<lock_id>\n
< OK\n | NOT_FOUND\n

> RENEW\t<lock_id>\t<new_ttl>\n
< OK\n | EXPIRED\n

> EVENT\t<resource>\t<event_type>\t<payload>\n  # optional emit for external consumers
```

### What stays inside the session processes

- Writing raw mail data (dbox segments, maildir files).
- Writing index updates (under the X lock on the mailbox).
- UID assignment (under the X lock — atomic read-increment-write of NEXTUID).
- IDLE notifications published over the `yarilo-locks` EVENT channel.

### Deadlock prevention

Code convention: always acquire locks in the order
`idx:<user>` → `mbox:<user>:<folder>` → `deliver:<user>:<folder>`.
If anything hangs, the TTL releases the lock automatically.

### Storage backend (remote mode only)

Redis (per backend deployment, or in the same namespace). Key: `lock:<resource>`,
Value: `<owner>|<acquired_at>`, TTL: 30 s. Atomic acquisition via Lua `SET ... NX EX`.

Embedded mode keeps the same key/value shape in a local `map[string]lockState` with a
background TTL sweeper — no external dependencies.

### HA (remote mode only)

- 2 replicas of `yarilo-locks` per backend deployment, behind a ClusterIP Service.
- Stateless (state in Redis).
- Local Redis, or shared with other components (warden, etc.).

Embedded mode has no HA — state is ephemeral; on process crash every lock is lost. Acceptable
for unit tests and CLI dev runs; not used in k8s deployments.

### Liveness vs readiness — why `yarilo-locks` has no watchdog self-check (#904)

The split, stated plainly so it is not "completed" back into a dependency probe:

- **liveness** = *local process state*. It restarts a process that is up but whose own request
  path is wedged.
- **readiness** = *Redis reachability*. It removes a pod from rotation when its backend is
  unreachable, and returns it automatically once Redis answers.

`yarilo-locks` in **remote mode deliberately wires no liveness self-check**, because it has no
local state that could wedge independently of Redis. The grant path is
`handleLock → RedisBackend.Acquire → Redis Lua script`, directly: `RedisBackend` holds no mutex,
no queue, no in-process shard — the acquire *is* the Redis round-trip. The only in-process grant
mutex is `MemoryBackend.mu`, and that backend is used **only** in embedded/test mode, never in
k8s. So the "up but locally wedged" state a liveness self-check exists to catch does not exist
here — there is nothing between accept and the Redis call to deadlock.

A self-check that round-trips Redis (the shape the #904 issue first sketched for this component)
is **rejected**: it re-creates the exact failure the watchdog guard-rail forbids. A hung Redis
(TCP alive, no replies) would hang that probe on **every** locks replica at once, restarting the
whole HA pool synchronously into a backoff loop — and a restart cannot fix a hung Redis. Both a
down Redis and a hung Redis already have the correct answer: the readiness ping hangs or fails,
the pod leaves rotation without a restart, and rejoins the moment Redis responds. Not-ready is
the right degradation; dead is not.

The dead-accept-loop and hard-crash cases are covered by `os.Exit(1)` on `Serve` error, no probe
involved. So the coverage is complete without a locks watchdog: crash → `os.Exit`; Redis
unreachable/hung → readiness; and there is no third, local-only failure mode to add.

**Revisit trigger.** If remote-mode `yarilo-locks` ever grows a genuine local stage in the grant
path — an in-process cache, a grant queue, an in-process shard — this decision is reopened: that
stage *can* wedge independently of Redis, and it should then get a liveness self-check that
acquires and releases a **probe-scoped** lock through that stage, bounded by a timeout well above
the worst-case acquire, and never reaching Redis. Until such a stage exists, there is nothing
local to probe.

## Standalone deployment — single-node k8s, scale-out by replicaCount

The standalone deployment targets a single k8s node, no director, no per-tag sharding. It is
**built to scale from 1 → N replicas of each component by editing values.yaml** — no rewiring,
no protocol changes, no code touched. The same pattern carries the operator from a one-pod dev
cluster to a small multi-replica production setup.

### Single-host, no Kubernetes — Docker Compose

For local development, evaluation and small self-hosted installs there is a
**Docker Compose** deployment ([deploy/compose/](https://github.com/yarilomail/yarilo/tree/main/deploy/compose),
[DOCKER-COMPOSE.md](DOCKER-COMPOSE.md)). It collapses the topology further: the
whole server runs as **one `yarilo` process** in `mode: single` — every protocol
plus embedded auth, warden and locks (in-memory) in-process, no login proxies and
no `yarilo-locks` service. The minimal profile needs no external dependencies
(SQLite userdb + local volumes); a `full` profile adds MariaDB and Redis. It is a
single-host target and is **not** highly available — for HA/scale-out use the
Helm standalone or backend deployments above.

### Components (all as k8s Deployments unless noted)

| Component | Default replicas | Scale by |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `yarilo-imap-login`, `yarilo-pop3-login`, `yarilo-submission-login` | 1 each | `replicaCount` per protocol (login is stateless beyond TLS state) |
| `yarilo-lmtp-login` | 0 (disabled by default) | `components.lmtpLogin.enabled: true` in values.yaml; MTA-facing LMTP proxy — warden CONNECT per recipient, SESSION token, preamble fan-out |
| `yarilo-jmap-login` | 1 | `replicaCount` (stateless beyond TLS; scales on request load) |
| `yarilo-imap`, `yarilo-pop3`, `yarilo-submission`, `yarilo-lmtp`, `yarilo-jmap` | 1 each | `replicaCount` per protocol (coordination via locks) |
| `yarilo-auth` | 1 | `replicaCount` (stateless; userdb in SQL) |
| `yarilo-warden` | 1 | `replicaCount` (state in Redis) |
| `yarilo-locks` | 2 | `replicaCount` (state in Redis; 2 = HA default) |
| `redis` | 1 (StatefulSet) | external HA or Sentinel for production |

### Storage

A single `PersistentVolumeClaim` with `accessModes: [ReadWriteMany]` — every session pod mounts
it at the same path. On single-node clusters this can be backed by `hostPath`, NFS, or a CSI
RWX provisioner; on multi-node clusters it must be NFS or CephFS.

### Routing

A k8s `Service` per public port (993, 995, 465, 587, 143, 110, 8443) load-balances connections
across the matching login pods. Port `24` is a `Service` in front of `yarilo-lmtp-login`
(when enabled) which fans out per-recipient preamble connections to `yarilo-lmtp` backends.
There is **no director** — sessions distribute round-robin (or
by k8s `Service`'s sessionAffinity setting). `yarilo-jmap-login` keeps its auth,
warden and proxy duties here and simply skips the director lookup, addressing the
`yarilo-jmap` Service directly; the binary is the same artefact as in the
director-backed shape, the routing target comes from config. Cross-pod write contention is resolved through
`yarilo-locks`; that adds RTT but stays correct. Once cross-pod contention is a measured
problem, the upgrade path is a director deployment (separate document); the session and login
binaries do not change.

### Scale invariants

- **`yarilo-locks` is always remote mode**, even at `replicaCount=1` for every other component.
  This is what keeps the deployment scalable without rework.
- **All session processes call the locks Service via mTLS TCP.** Storage code uses
  `pkg/locks.Locker` only; no compile-time switch on deployment shape.
- **Storage is RWX from day one.** Switching from RWO to RWX later requires a data migration
  and a full re-deploy. Doing it up front costs nothing extra.

### Out of scope for standalone

- Per-tag sharding (multiple NFS shares, different user populations on different backends).
  That belongs to the backend deployment (see `/yarilo_backend.svg`).
- Director-based sticky routing and consistent hashing. Standalone uses k8s `Service`
  load-balancing; if measured contention warrants it, switch to director without touching
  the session binaries.

## Helm chart structure

```
helm/yarilo-shared        → auth + warden + Redis (shared across the installation)
helm/yarilo-director      → director pool
helm/yarilo-backend       → backend pool (one release per tag = per NFS shard, with its own locks)
```

### yarilo-shared
- `Deployment yarilo-auth` — replicaCount=2, stateless (userdb in an external SQL/LDAP).
- `Deployment yarilo-warden` — replicaCount=2, state in Redis.
- `Deployment redis` (or external) — state backend for warden.
- A ClusterIP Service for each.

### yarilo-director
- `Deployment yarilo-director` — replicaCount=3, self-organizing ring (#750): each
  replica dials only its right neighbor in `(ip, port)` sort order, never a full
  mesh, and every member count (including N=1, a lone replica) is a fully valid,
  service-serving state. Plain Deployment, not a StatefulSet — no per-pod stable
  network identity is needed. The headless `-director-ring` Service (#748/#751)
  is the join seed: its DNS name resolves directly to every ready pod's IP (not
  a single virtual IP), so any resolver hit lands on a live replica to
  `DIRECTOR-JOIN` against; membership is self-maintaining from there.
- 4 login-proxy processes (`yarilo-imap-login`, `yarilo-pop3-login`, `yarilo-submission-login`, `yarilo-lmtp-login`) — in separate containers or under a master-supervised process tree.
- ClusterIP Service — public entry point: :993/:995/:587/:24.
- ClusterIP Service (`-director-ring`) — internal ring protocol port; also the join seed.

### yarilo-backend (one release per tag, e.g. `yarilo-backend-a`)
**One co-located StatefulSet per tag** — the pod runs all four protocol containers plus the registration sidecar:

- `StatefulSet yarilo-backend-<tag>` — replicaCount=N. Pod containers:
  `yarilo-imap`, `yarilo-pop3`, `yarilo-submission`, `yarilo-lmtp`,
  `yarilo-managesieve`, `yarilo-fts` (`fts_addr = localhost`), and
  `yarilo-backend-reg` (registration sidecar). All share the pod IP.
- `Deployment yarilo-locks-<tag>` — replicaCount=2, cross-pod write coordination.
- `Deployment redis-<tag>` (or shared Redis) — state backend for locks.
- `Deployment yarilo-quota-status-<tag>` — global-read Postfix policy service,
  own replicaCount, stable ClusterIP for the external MTA (NOT in the pod;
  `backend-api` IS in the pod — see the co-location criterion above).
- One **PVC NFS (RWX)** — shared by all pods within the tag.
- One Headless Service — stable per-pod DNS for sticky routing from the director.

**Why co-located, not per-protocol StatefulSets:**
- **Routing coherence (the whole point).** Consistent hashing cannot give both
  "1 user = 1 pod across protocols" *and* independent per-protocol pod pools — they
  are mathematically incompatible. Separate pools would hash the same user to
  *different* pods for IMAP vs LMTP, so every cross-protocol write (LMTP delivery →
  the mailbox an IMAP session on another pod holds) crosses pods and fights over
  `yarilo-locks` / index-cache coherence. Co-locating restores the reference's
  one-mail-host invariant and makes the single ring + single userDir **correct**,
  not merely a shortcut (this is the causal fix for #788, not a workaround).
- **FTS single-writer for free (#675/#676).** The per-user Xapian index has the same
  single-writer requirement as the mailbox. Co-locating `yarilo-fts` (localhost)
  puts the user's index write handle on their already-sticky pod, so each per-user
  index on the shared NFS has exactly one writer cluster-wide — no fts ring, no
  ClusterIP round-robin corruption. One invariant ("1 user = 1 pod") fixes #788 and
  #675/#676 together.
- **One IP per user.** The director stores one pod IP per user; that IP serves every
  protocol, so no protocol dimension is needed on the ring, the userDir, or the wire.
- Vertical sizing stays per-protocol — each **container** keeps its own CPU/RAM
  limits. What is given up is **independent per-protocol replica-count / HPA**: you
  scale the pod (all protocols together), not one protocol's pool. This is a
  deliberate trade of an unused scaling axis for routing correctness.

**Trade-off (documented, accepted):** the whole pod scales as a unit, and one
unready protocol container takes the pod (all protocols) out of the ring — see the
readiness-gate semantics under "backend liveness". Cross-protocol writes still go
through `yarilo-locks` for cross-*pod* coordination (a user's replicas across the
tag), but same-user same-protocol traffic is pinned to one pod.

### Director routing — one ring

The director maintains **one** consistent-hashing ring and **one** user→pod
directory: `MD5(user) → yarilo-backend-<tag>-N` (the pod IP). The same pod answers
IMAP, POP3, Submission and LMTP for that user; the login proxy dials the
protocol-specific port on the resolved pod IP. `tag` selects the NFS shard, never
the protocol. There is no per-protocol ring — a single user never lands on
different pods for different protocols.

**Admin per-user ops reach the owning pod the same way (#792).** `yarilo-backend-api`
listens on the pod IP only, so a per-user admin op (`yarctl backend fts
rescan <user>`, folder/quota/index/… on a user) must hit the user's pod.
`yarctl` does the routing **client-side**: it asks the director
`GET /api/director/map?user=X` — which resolves with the *same* precedence a
login LOOKUP uses (sticky userDir pin → ring hash, the director owning the
assignment; #708 removed the separate admin-override map) — then dials
`http://{pod-ip}:{backend_api_port}`. It never picks
a pod itself: a client-side choice would race a concurrent login and put two pods
on one user's FTS index, breaking the single-writer invariant. Routing auto-enables
when a director URL is configured (co-located); with no director it uses the fixed
`--backend-url` (standalone). `--route-by-user=false` is a debug escape hatch for
talking to one pod directly. If the director is unreachable the op fails with a
clear error — never a silent fall-through to a random pod. Global ops (dict,
user iterate) carry no user and always use the fixed URL.

---

## Where the chart's CPU limits come from

**Two of nineteen were measured. The rest are starting points.**

Every `limits.cpu` in `helm/values.yaml` now says which it is, so the file can be
read for what it knows rather than what it appears to advise:

| | |
|:---|:---|
| `fts` — `1` | measured: one core saturates under sandbox delivery load, which is why `fts_index_workers` stays at 1 |
| `jmap` — `500m` | measured once and **found short**: 1.31 cores wanted under 8 clients and 50 users, with 81% of scheduling periods throttled (#1026) |
| the other seventeen | unmeasured (#1040) |

The numbers are not even uniform — `500m` for `director`, `pop3`, `lmtp`,
`manageSieve` and `jmap`, `1000m` for `imap`, `200m` for most login layers — so
there is no single policy behind them to reconstruct.

**What an unexplained limit costs.** The first time anyone measured against one,
JMAP read latency came out at a 5-second median and was investigated as an
algorithmic defect twice, by two people, before the limit was found. A wrong
limit does not fail; it produces numbers that look like a code problem.

**So measure under your own load before trusting any of them.** The method is in
[Testing](./TESTING#check-for-cpu-throttling-before-believing-a-latency-number):
run the matching job from `hack/loadtest/`, read `cpu.stat` inside the container,
and establish the appetite with a second run at a different limit — one run only
tells you the limit you chose, not where the workload stops asking.

**Throttling is invisible in yarilo's own `/metrics`.** It is a kubelet counter,
`container_cpu_cfs_throttled_periods_total`, exported through cAdvisor. Nothing
scrapes it in the sandbox, so the reading has to be taken during a run or
recorded with the result — after the fact, "was it throttled yesterday" has no
answer.

The tables below are estimates from the same period as the defaults, and carry
the same caveat.

## Sizing per backend pod

| Workload | RAM | CPU |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 5k idle (mostly IMAP IDLE) | ~300–500 MB | ~0.1 cores |
| 2k active | ~500–800 MB | ~0.3–0.5 cores |
| Burst (FETCH of a large mail × 100 users) | up to ~2 GB peak | up to 1–2 cores peak |

**Recommended Helm values:**
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 250m
    memory: 512Mi
  limits:
    cpu: 2000m
    memory: 2Gi
```

**Bottlenecks (in order):**
1. **Open FDs** — `ulimit -n 65535` is required (default 1024 is too low). ~10 FD per session.
2. **NFS IOPS** — the most likely bottleneck. SSD-backed NFS plus `cachefilesd`/`fscache` help.
3. **yarilo-locks RTT** — every write does LOCK/UNLOCK. Local Redis → ~1–2 ms per pair.
4. **NFS bandwidth** — attachment FETCH. 1 Gbps = 125 MB/s.
5. **RAM on burst** — buffers for reading large mails.

---

## Sizing per backend tag (one co-located StatefulSet + one NFS share + local locks)

| Parameter | Typical | Min/Max |
|:---|:---|:---|
| yarilo-backend replicaCount (co-located pod) | 3–5 | 1 / scale-out |
| per-container resources (imap/pop3/submission/lmtp) | sized independently within the pod | see "Sizing per backend pod" |
| locks replicaCount | **2** | stateless, ClusterIP |
| Users per pod | **3–5k** mostly idle | Goroutines are cheap, but FD/RAM limits apply |
| **Total users per tag** | **10–20k** | NFS server is the constraint |
| NFS share size | **5–10 TB** | 10k users × ~500 MB average quota |
| NFS sustained IOPS | **10–30k** | Index/mailbox operations |
| NFS bandwidth | **1–10 Gbps** | Attachment transfer |

---

## When to create a new tag

| Trigger | Threshold |
|:---|:---|
| NFS storage used | > 70–75% |
| NFS sustained IOPS | > 70% of capacity |
| Users per tag | > 15–20k |
| p99 latency for simple IMAP ops | > 200 ms |

One Helm release `yarilo-backend` per tag: `yarilo-backend-a`, `yarilo-backend-b`, …
Each with its own NFS PV and its own `yarilo-locks` service.

**Scale examples:**
- 10k users → 1 tag, 3 replicas, 5 TB NFS.
- 50k users → 3–4 tags, each with 3 replicas × 5 TB.
- 200k+ → 10–15 tags; start considering non-NFS storage.

---

## Director routing & stickiness

**Ring:** `MD5(username) → co-located backend pod` (within a single tag). One ring,
one pod IP per user, serving every protocol — the login proxy dials the
protocol-specific port on that IP.
**Tag assignment:** a separate user → tag map (admin-defined or hash-based shard) —
`tag` = NFS shard, not protocol.

1. Client → director's login proxy (TLS terminate).
2. Login proxy: passdb in-process (auth only: password + allow_nets), then userdb for home/mail. Backend receives user info via extended XCLIENT, skips passdb/userdb.
3. Director: determines the user's tag; the ring maps user → pod.
4. Director connects directly to the pod via stable DNS (headless Service).
5. Passes auth state in the preamble, proxies plain TCP.

`userDir` in the director is an in-memory cache of active user → pod mappings.
Synced between directors over the peer protocol.

## HA strategy

| Layer | HA approach |
|:---|:---|
| Director | replicaCount=3, self-organizing ring (#750) |
| Backend per tag | replicaCount=3–5, shared NFS RWX, ring rebalance |
| yarilo-locks (per tag) | replicaCount=2, state in Redis |
| yarilo-auth | replicaCount=2, stateless |

**Backend failover sequence:**
1. The pod stops heartbeating — the `yarilo-backend-reg` sidecar sends BACKEND-DOWN
   on SIGTERM (immediate); a hard kill or any unready protocol container → the
   sidecar goes silent → TTL expiry (#776). Either way the **whole pod** leaves the
   ring for all protocols.
2. Director removes it from the ring.
3. Locks on the dead pod expire via TTL (30 s) on `yarilo-locks-<tag>`.
4. Ring rehash → users move to neighbouring replicas in the same tag.
5. The k8s scheduler brings up a new pod (~30 s).
6. The new pod mounts the same NFS and starts accepting connections.

## Initial placement policy — `director_service.assignment_policy` (#797)

Only the **first** (unpinned) user→backend assignment consults the policy; sticky
pins and USER-MOVE are unaffected. The director is the **single
owner** of placement — the LOOKUP path, LMTP `RouteUser`, and the admin
per-user resolve (#792) all funnel through one `assignAndPin`, so no caller can
independently pick a pod and split a user's per-user writer (#788).

- **`hash`** (default, the reference semantics): the consistent-hash backend for the
  user's tag. Deterministic — if a sticky entry expires after long inactivity the
  user returns to the same pod (warm per-user index locality on the shared PV,
  easy debugging).
- **`least_sessions`**: the least-loaded Up backend in the tag by a two-level,
  capacity-normalized load — **level 1** the requesting protocol's sessions,
  **level 2** total sessions among level-1 ties; each `count*100/vhosts`
  (`vhosts` 1..100; **`vhosts: 0` = drain → excluded**); tie-break lower
  `(ip, port)`. Session counts come from the live SESSION-OPEN/CLOSE registry
  (no new plumbing), which now carries a trailing `proto` field on LOOKUP /
  SESSION-OPEN. The admin resolve has no protocol → level 1 is skipped, total
  load decides. Session counts are replicated ring-wide (SESSION-OPEN/CLOSE gossiped as (origin, seq) envelopes, #804), so whichever random replica answers a LOOKUP decides on the full cluster view — not just the sessions on the watch-holding replica.

**Trade-offs (least_sessions).** It gives up hash determinism: an expired-then-
returning user may land on a different pod than before. Acceptable because the
data lives on the shared tag PV, but it must be a deliberate operator choice —
hence the `hash` default. Second, because a fresh resolve now **pins**, a bulk
admin sweep over never-logged-in users (e.g. `yarctl backend fts rescan`
across a cohort) creates userDir entries for each — a deliberate side effect (the
pins TTL-expire), so don't be surprised by a populated userDir after a mass
operation. Reference parity: the reference does hash + vhosts weighting only;
`least_sessions` is a yarilo extension, default stays reference-compatible.

## USER-MOVE and pin longevity (#708)

An admin **USER-MOVE** (`yarctl director users <u> move …`) is an
**operational tool — "shift this user off that backend now" — not permanent
routing configuration.** It writes a normal, TTL'd userDir pin at the target
(replicated ring-wide via the same `USER-MOVED` gossip) and immediately kicks
the user's sessions on the old backend so the next connection lands on the new
one. There is **no permanent-override map** (removed in #708) and **no
USER-RELEASE** — a move just expires.

**Longevity is session-driven, not permanent.** While the user holds a live
proxied session, the director keeps the pin's TTL fresh: every `user_expire/2`
it touches the pin of every user with an active session in the replicated
session registry (#804). Each director refreshes from its own ring-replicated
session view, so no extra propagation is needed. Once the user's **last session
closes**, the touches stop and the pin **lapses back to the ring hash** after
`director_service.user_expire`. So a move survives exactly as long as the user
stays connected; an idle user deterministically returns to their hash backend.

Operators who need a **permanent** placement should use **tags** (a user's
tag-pool is routing configuration), not a move.

## Kick pacing — `user_kick_delay` and `max_parallel_kicks` (#740)

Two knobs shape how sessions are torn down, mirroring the reference's
`director_user_kick_delay` / `director_max_parallel_kicks`:

- **`director_service.user_kick_delay`** (default `2`s) — an admin-initiated
  kick (director API, typically the tail of a user move) waits this long before
  the `USER-KICKED` push, so an in-flight command on the old backend can
  complete. Applies to the **admin path only**: a backend-down / lease-expiry
  kick fires immediately (there is nothing to grace on a dead backend), and the
  split-writer conflict-kick is never delayed. Negative = disabled (immediate).

- **`director_service.max_parallel_kicks`** (default `100`) — when a backend
  goes down, its sessions are kicked in batches of this size with a short pause
  between batches, spreading the re-login stampede across the surviving backends
  instead of firing every kick at once. Negative = no batching.

**Migration note:** a legacy `director_max_parallel_moves` setting has **no yarilo
equivalent and is intentionally omitted**. yarilo rehashes lazily — a moved or
kicked user is re-placed only on its next `LOOKUP` (kick → re-login → LOOKUP),
so there is no proactive bulk-move phase to bound; the move rate is already
capped by `max_parallel_kicks`. A parsed-but-unread key would be a config gap,
so the key does not exist rather than existing as a no-op.

## Stickiness rationale

User X is always served by a single backend pod (within the same tag). Reasons:
- Less cross-pod lock contention in `yarilo-locks`.
- Index cache locality.
- Avoid duplicated IDLE notifications.
- Faster session startup (cache prewarmed).

Stickiness ≠ data partitioning. Data is shared on NFS; sticky routing is an optimisation.

## Why event-loop (goroutines), not fork

yarilo is written in Go. Go runtime + `fork()` = undefined behaviour — forbidden by CLAUDE.md.
- `exec.Command` — to launch child processes at pod startup.
- **Goroutines per user** within a process — one goroutine per user session.

This is fundamentally different from the reference C model (fork per user → process per user →
~10 MB per session). yarilo holds 1000+ users in a single process without resource overhead.
