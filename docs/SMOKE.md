# End-to-end smoke test

Drives a live yarilo instance through the full happy-path mail flow:
authenticate → deliver → read.

| Step | What it exercises |
|:---|:---|
| Submission AUTH PLAIN over STARTTLS | passdb chain, bcrypt verify, STARTTLS handshake |
| Submission AUTH LOGIN over STARTTLS | legacy SASL LOGIN mechanism (Outlook, Android MUAs) |
| LMTP delivery | storage write path, auto-provisioning of new mailboxes |
| IMAPS LOGIN command | IMAP native `LOGIN user password` (RFC 3501) |
| IMAPS AUTHENTICATE PLAIN | IMAP SASL PLAIN via AUTHENTICATE |
| POP3S USER/PASS | POP3 native `USER` + `PASS` |
| POP3S AUTH PLAIN (SASL) | POP3 SASL PLAIN via AUTH (RFC 5034), with initial response |

The harness lives in [`app/smoketest-e2e`](https://github.com/yarilomail/yarilo/tree/main/app/smoketest-e2e) and runs against any yarilo deployment exposing the listeners — local binary, docker compose, or staging cluster.

## Quick local run

Generate a self-signed cert + seed a bcrypt-hashed user in SQLite, then start yarilo and run the smoke binary.

```sh
# 1. Workspace
mkdir -p /tmp/yarilo-smoke/{tls,data,mail}
cd /tmp/yarilo-smoke

# 2. Self-signed test certificate (30 days)
openssl req -x509 -newkey ec -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:P-256 \
  -keyout tls/key.pem -out tls/cert.pem -days 30 -nodes \
  -subj "/CN=mail.smoke.local" \
  -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:mail.smoke.local,DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1"

# 3. Seed bcrypt user in SQLite (uses the same passdb code yarilo does)
go run /path/to/yarilo/app/smoketest-e2e/seed/main.go \
  /tmp/yarilo-smoke/data/users.db alice@smoke.local wonderland

# 4. Start yarilo with the smoke config (see below)
go build -o /tmp/yarilo /path/to/yarilo/app/yarilo
/tmp/yarilo -config /tmp/yarilo-smoke/yarilo.yaml &

# 5. Run the smoke
go run /path/to/yarilo/app/smoketest-e2e/ -insecure

# Expected:
# [PASS] submission AUTH PLAIN over STARTTLS
# [PASS] LMTP deliver to mailbox
# [PASS] IMAPS LOGIN + SELECT INBOX + FETCH
# [PASS] POP3S USER/PASS + STAT + RETR
```

`-insecure` accepts the self-signed certificate. Drop the flag when running against staging/prod with a real CA-signed cert.

## Smoke config (`/tmp/yarilo-smoke/yarilo.yaml`)

Uses high ports (9000+) to avoid needing root.

```yaml
mode: single
general:
  ssl:
    ssl_server_cert_file: /tmp/yarilo-smoke/tls/cert.pem
    ssl_server_key_file:  /tmp/yarilo-smoke/tls/key.pem
  haproxy:
    haproxy_trusted_networks: ["127.0.0.1/32"]
  xclient:
    trusted_nets: ["127.0.0.1/32"]
  limits:
    mail_max_userip_connections: 0

services:
  imaps:       { enabled: true, port: 9993, ssl_mode: ssl }
  imap:        { enabled: true, port: 9143, ssl_mode: starttls }
  submission:  { enabled: true, port: 9587, ssl_mode: starttls }
  submissions: { enabled: true, port: 9465, ssl_mode: ssl }
  pop3:        { enabled: true, port: 9110, ssl_mode: starttls }
  pop3s:       { enabled: true, port: 9995, ssl_mode: ssl }
  lmtp:        { enabled: true, port: 9024, ssl_mode: "no" }

protocol:
  submission:
    hostname: mail.smoke.local
    submission_max_mail_size: 41943040
  lmtp:
    add_received_header: true

auth:
  passdb:
    - driver: sqlite
      dsn: /tmp/yarilo-smoke/data/users.db

storage:
  mail_driver: maildir
  maildir_root: /tmp/yarilo-smoke/mail

log:
  level: debug
```

## CLI flags

```
-host          target hostname           (default: 127.0.0.1)
-user          mailbox login             (default: alice@smoke.local)
-pass          password                  (default: wonderland)
-submission-port  STARTTLS submission    (default: 9587)
-lmtp-port        plain TCP LMTP         (default: 9024)
-imaps-port       IMAPS                  (default: 9993)
-pop3s-port       POP3S                  (default: 9995)
-insecure         skip TLS verify         (default: true)
-timeout          per-step timeout        (default: 10s)
```

Against a real deployment, point `-host` at the public hostname and use the standard ports `587 / 24 / 993 / 995`, no `-insecure`.

## What auto-provisioning means

When LMTP receives a message for a user whose Maildir doesn't exist, it creates `INBOX/{cur,new,tmp}/` and proceeds. This matches the reference's behavior — LMTP is internal, the upstream MTA has already vetted recipients.

If you want strict recipient validation at the LMTP layer (instead of trusting the MTA), file an issue — there's currently no `lmtp_reject_unknown_recipients` knob.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| 0 | All four steps passed. |
| 1 | One or more steps failed (details on stderr). |

## JMAP header forms and property validation

The last JMAP check is the only one that **writes**. It appends its own message
to a folder of its own, `YariloSmoke`, reads it back through every `header:*`
form of RFC 8621 §4.1.3, and removes both afterwards.

It brings its own message because the alternative is depending on whatever
happens to be in the mailbox — which differs per deployment, so a green run
would mean different things in different places.

**The folder rather than INBOX** because the check runs on every rollout, and a
message left behind changes the mailbox every other measurement is taken
against. Cleanup is best effort and **reported when it fails**: leaving the
folder is recoverable, not knowing it was left is not.

It needs `-jmap-user` and `-jmap-pass`, and it is skipped without them.

What it asserts beyond the forms themselves:

- the response carries **only** the requested properties — an unprojected answer
  states `hasAttachment: false` for a message that has one;
- a missing header is answered `null` and is **present** in the object, checked
  separately from its value because in Go a missing key and a null value are
  both `nil`;
- a misspelled property is refused with `invalidArguments` — silence there is
  indistinguishable from a property yarilo has not implemented;
- `headers` lists every field in the order the message carries them.

## What the smoke test writes, and what it removes

It writes. Run it against an account whose mail you are willing to have touched
in the ways below, and nothing else.

| check | writes | removes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| sieve checks | one message per check, delivered by LMTP | its own message, by the unique subject it sent |
| sieve `fileinto` and friends | messages into folders they create | those folders' contents |
| FTS | one message with a unique marker | nothing |
| JMAP header forms | one message in `YariloSmoke` | that message and the folder |

**It does not empty INBOX**, and must not. It did until #1056: a helper selected
INBOX, searched for everything and expunged it, twenty-five times per run.
Nothing in the flags or in this document said the account had to be disposable,
and the loss was silent — the delete ignored its error and the helper returned
nothing on any failure path.

Every check identifies its own message by a unique subject or marker, which is
what it needed all along; the clearing was defensive and destructive at once.
`TestNothingEmptiesTheInbox` reads the source and fails on any function that
selects INBOX, searches `ALL` and deletes the result — deleting a message the
check itself sent stays allowed, because the fault was the breadth and not the
delete.
