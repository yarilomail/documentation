# JMAP configuration

> **Status: in progress.** The session resource (RFC 8620 §2), the request
> envelope (§3) and the read-only `Mailbox` methods (RFC 8621 §2) are served
> end-to-end; the remaining data methods land in later phases.

JMAP runs as two binaries, not one. `yarilo-jmap-login` faces clients and
`yarilo-jmap` owns the user's state; see
[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for the topology and the reasoning behind it.

| Binary | Faces | Terminates client TLS | Runs the passdb chain |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|
| `yarilo-jmap-login` | the internet | yes | yes |
| `yarilo-jmap` | the login pod only | no | no |

---

## Listeners

| Service key | Port | Served by | Protocol |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `jmap` | `8443` | `yarilo-jmap-login` | HTTPS, client-facing |
| `jmap_be` | `10443` | `yarilo-jmap` | HTTP over internal mTLS |

`10443` sits in the backend data range next to `10143`/`10110`/`10587`/`10024`
and deliberately clear of `8080`, which is the telemetry port on every
component pod.

---

## Trust between the two

The backend runs no authentication of its own: the login layer already ran the
passdb chain and asserts the user in `X-Yarilo-User`. It therefore honours those
headers only from a peer it has been configured to trust. Three modes, evaluated
in order, all default-deny:

| # | Configure | Anchor | Anything else |
|:--|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | `internal_tls.enabled: true` | the peer's certificate | `403` |
| 2 | `services.jmap_be.xclient_protocol: true` + `general.xclient.trusted_nets` | the peer's address | `403` |
| 3 | neither | none | `403` on every request |

Mode 2 reuses `general.xclient.trusted_nets`, the same list that already decides
whether a forwarded client IP is believed for XCLIENT and `IMAP ID
x-originating-ip` — `Forwarded` is the HTTP member of that family, not a new
mechanism.

In mode 3 the listener still binds and answers `403` with a named cause, and the
backend logs `no trust anchor for the login hop` once at startup. A dead port
would read as a network fault and send the operator looking in the wrong place.

`allow_nets` is not enforced here: the login pod checks it against the real
client before proxying, exactly as it does for the byte-pipe protocols.

---

## `protocol.jmap`

Every limit is advertised in the session resource as well as enforced, because
clients batch against what is published.

| Key | Default | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `jmap_base_url` | — | Public origin clients reach this deployment on. Prefixes every URL in the session resource, so it must be the externally visible name, not a pod address. |
| `jmap_max_concurrent_requests` | `10` | Simultaneous API calls per session. |
| `jmap_max_calls_in_request` | `16` | Method calls in one batch. |
| `jmap_max_objects_in_get` | `500` | Objects per `Foo/get`. |
| `jmap_max_objects_in_set` | `500` | Objects per `Foo/set`. |
| `jmap_max_size_upload` | `40M` | One blob upload. |
| `jmap_max_size_request` | `10M` | One API request body. |
| `jmap_max_body_value_bytes` | `256K` | Server ceiling on one returned `Email` body value. A smaller client `maxBodyValueBytes` wins; truncated values are marked `isTruncated`. |
| `jmap_query_max_limit` | `256` | Server ceiling on ids returned by one query. A smaller client `limit` wins; the response reports the limit applied. |
| `jmap_push_timeout` | `90` | Idle timeout for a push connection, seconds. Unused until the push phase. |
| `jmap_cors_allow_origins` | `[]` | Browser origins allowed to call the endpoint. Empty denies every cross-origin request. Exact match, scheme included. |

The session `state` string is derived from these values, so changing one
invalidates a client's cached session and nothing else does.

## Helm

```yaml
components:
  jmap:                    # the backend container
    enabled: true
    listeners:
      jmap:
        containerPort: 10443
        xclient: false     # trust mode 2; leave off when internalTLS is on
    internalTLS:
      enabled: true
      secretName: yarilo-internal-tls

  jmapLogin:               # the client-facing proxy
    enabled: true
    backend_port: 10443    # the JMAP container's port, not the pod's
    director_addr: "yarilo-director:9090"
    tls:
      secretName: jmap-tls

protocol:
  jmap:
    jmap_base_url: "https://mail.example.com"
```

Under the co-located backend model (`components.backend.coLocated: true`, the
director shape) `yarilo-jmap` renders as one more container in the backend pod
and shares its pod IP, so a user reaches every protocol on the address the ring
resolved. With `coLocated: false` (the standalone shape) it renders as its own
Deployment plus a headless Service, like the other backends.

---

## The API endpoint

`POST /jmap/api/` runs a batch of method calls. Two things about it are worth
stating because they are choices, not consequences of the RFC:

**Core is not implicit.** A client must name every capability it relies on in
`using`, including `urn:ietf:params:jmap:core`. A method whose capability is
absent is answered with `unknownMethod` — the same answer as a method that does
not exist (RFC 8620 §3.2). That is what lets the server gain capabilities
without changing how an older client behaves.

**Failures have two levels.** A request-level fault — malformed JSON, a missing
`methodCalls`, an unknown capability, an exceeded request limit — aborts the
batch and returns a problem document. A method-level fault becomes an `error`
response for that one call, and the rest of the batch still runs; a client
matches responses to calls by `callId`, never by position.

**No method executes until the entire envelope is read and parsed; streaming
execution is forbidden.** A request is either rejected whole or run whole, which
is what makes the request-level problems above meaningful. It also fixes the
boundary for the mutating methods that arrive later: a batch cannot be applied
halfway because the client's connection died mid-body.

Back-references (§3.7) resolve against the responses produced so far, so a
reference forward, or into a call answered with `error`, is
`invalidResultReference` by construction. The path is a JSON Pointer (RFC 6901)
extended with `*`, which maps the remainder over an array and flattens one
level.

### Request limits

| Bound | Enforced by | Refusal |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `jmap_max_size_request` | `yarilo-jmap-login`, at the edge | `413` with a `limit` problem naming `maxSizeRequest` |
| `jmap_max_calls_in_request` | `yarilo-jmap` | `400` with a `limit` problem naming `maxCallsInRequest` |

The body cap runs in the login pod so an oversized request is refused before it
is proxied and no backend ever reads it. The backend keeps the same cap as a
floor: a request arriving there oversized means the hop was bypassed. Every
limit problem carries the `limit` member (§3.6.1) — "too big" is useless without
naming the bound.

The clean refusal needs a declared length. A request whose `Content-Length`
exceeds the cap is answered with the `limit` problem before anything is read; a
chunked body, or one that understates its length, is instead cut off by the
reader as it is proxied, so that client sees a broken response rather than a
problem document. The excess never reaches a backend either way, and a client
sending `Content-Length` — which is every real JMAP client — always gets the
parseable answer.

---

## Mailboxes

`Mailbox/get` and `Mailbox/query` are read-only and expose the **personal
namespace** only; shared and public namespaces arrive with the namespace phase.

| JMAP member | Source |
|:---|:---|
| `id` | the folder GUID from the index — stable across a rename, which the name is not |
| `name` | the leaf name; hierarchy travels in `parentId`, so a client never learns the delimiter |
| `role` | IMAP special-use, per-user overrides layered over `imap_special_use_defaults`; `INBOX` is `inbox` without carrying an attribute |
| `totalEmails` / `unreadEmails` | the folder's own counters, the same ones `STATUS` reports |
| `totalThreads` / `unreadThreads` | equal to the message counts: until threading lands each message is its own thread |
| `isSubscribed` | the same subscriptions file IMAP reads, so one `SUBSCRIBE` shows in both protocols |
| `myRights` | full rights in the personal namespace; a `\NoSelect` container reports no read, add, remove or submit |

A `\NoSelect` container appears in the list with a `container:` id. It holds no
mail, but omitting it would leave its children pointing at a parent the client
never saw.

Both methods read control files under the cross-process lock, so a concurrent
IMAP `SUBSCRIBE` or `CREATE (USE ...)` cannot be observed half-applied. The
backend refuses to start without a locks client for that reason.

### State strings

`Mailbox/get` returns `state` and `Mailbox/query` returns `queryState`; both are
a digest of the mailbox set. They tell a client that something moved, never
what. `canCalculateChanges` is `false` and stays false until `Mailbox/changes`
lands, so a client refetches rather than diffing — the same non-incremental
contract `Email/query` will start with.

### What is refused rather than approximated

A filter operator (`AND`/`OR`/`NOT`) is answered with `unsupportedFilter`, and a
sort on any property other than `sortOrder`, `name` or `parentId` with
`unsupportedSort`. Silently matching everything, or returning a different order
than the one asked for, would render the wrong list in a client that had no way
to know.

---

## Emails

`Email/get` is read-only. It answers by id — a null `ids` is refused, since it
would select every message the account has and no limit would bound the cost.

| JMAP member | Source |
|:---|:---|
| `id`, `blobId` | the message GUID — the same identity IMAP reports as `EMAILID` (RFC 8474), so one message is one object whichever protocol reaches it |
| `threadId` | the message's own id: until threading lands each message is its own thread |
| `mailboxIds`, `keywords`, `size`, `receivedAt` | the index |
| envelope fields, body parts, `preview` | the message itself, parsed on demand |
| `keywords` | IMAP system flags translated to the JMAP vocabulary — `\Seen` is `$seen` |

### A message that cannot be parsed still exists

Malformed MIME headers are ordinary in real mail — spam, broken clients,
truncated delivery. Such a message is returned with the properties the index
carries (`id`, `mailboxIds`, `keywords`, `size`, `receivedAt`) and with the
header-derived ones empty. It is **not** reported as `notFound`: `Email/query`
lists it, download serves its bytes and IMAP shows it, so calling it absent
would leave a client unable to reconcile its own view of the account.

A message whose file cannot be read at all is the other condition and keeps its
own answer — there the store cannot produce it, download answers `404` too, and
the methods agree that it is absent. The distinction is what keeps the three
consistent: they disagree about how much of a message can be rendered, never
about whether it is there.

### The message is opened only when it is needed

A request naming only index-backed properties — `id`, `mailboxIds`, `keywords`,
`size`, `receivedAt` — never opens the message. Everything else, envelope fields
included, comes from the parsed message, so naming any of them reads it.
A request naming no properties gets the full default set, which reads it.

Body *values* are separate again: they are returned only for
`fetchTextBodyValues` / `fetchHTMLBodyValues` / `fetchAllBodyValues`. The
structural lists (`textBody`, `htmlBody`, `attachments`) are metadata and cost
the parse but not the content.

### Body value size

`jmap_max_body_value_bytes` is the server's ceiling on one returned body value.
The client's own `maxBodyValueBytes` (RFC 8621 §4.2.2) wins when smaller; a
client naming none gets the ceiling rather than the whole body, because the
ceiling bounds the operator's work rather than expressing a client preference.

Every truncated value carries `isTruncated: true`. A server may return less than
the whole part; it may not do so silently. The cut lands on a UTF-8 rune
boundary, and an HTML value additionally drops a trailing partial tag rather
than emitting markup a client renders as text.

**Worst-case arithmetic, so the two knobs are visibly multiplied:**

```
returned body bytes  <=  jmap_max_objects_in_get x jmap_max_body_value_bytes
                     =   500 x 256K  =  128M   (at the defaults)
```

Reading and parsing the raw messages is **not** bounded by the ceiling — that
cost is proportional to the messages themselves. It is the same cost an IMAP
`FETCH BODY[]` of the same messages incurs, so no new surface appears: an
authenticated user is reading their own mail either way. What the ceiling bounds
is the response, and with it the memory held per request.

---

## Finding and downloading messages

`Email/query` answers the conditions the mail index carries: `inMailbox`,
`inMailboxOtherThan`, `before`, `after`, `minSize`, `maxSize`, `hasKeyword`,
`notKeyword`. Sort is `receivedAt` (default, newest first) or `size`; the id
breaks every tie, so two runs of the same query agree and a client paging with
`position` never sees a message twice or misses one.

**Full-text conditions are refused, by name.** `text`, `from`, `to`, `cc`,
`bcc`, `subject`, `body` and `header` need the full-text index, which this phase
does not reach. The refusal is `unsupportedFilter` with the offending conditions
listed in `description`, so a client can drop exactly those and retry — or fall
back to its own filtering over a server-side list. Answering them by ignoring
them would return a confidently wrong result set, which a client has no way to
detect.

### Result size

`jmap_query_max_limit` (default 256) is the ceiling on returned ids. The
client's own `limit` wins when smaller; a client naming none gets the ceiling
rather than the whole result set. RFC 8620 §5.5 permits this provided the
response says so, and it does: `limit` in the response is the value that was
applied, which is what tells a client to page with `position`.

### Query state

`queryState` is a digest of everything that determines the result:

- the filter and the sort — two queries with different arguments describe
  different lists and must not share a state a client could cache one against
  the other;
- the **composition** of the folder set in scope — creating or deleting a
  folder changes the result without moving any surviving folder's modseq;
- each in-scope folder's `UIDVALIDITY` and `HIGHESTMODSEQ` — these move on
  delivery, flag change and expunge.

A filter naming one mailbox reads only that mailbox, so a delivery elsewhere
does not move this query's state. It is deliberately coarser than a change log:
a flag change in a folder the query reads moves the state even when the filter
does not depend on flags. `canCalculateChanges` stays `false` until a change
journal exists, so a client refetches rather than diffing.

### Download

`GET /jmap/download/{accountId}/{blobId}/{name}` streams the message.

The blob is resolved against the authenticated user's own mail **before**
anything is opened, so a blobId belonging to somebody else is a `404` that never
touched their file — ownership is a precondition, not a check applied to an open
handle. Another account's blob and a nonexistent one answer identically, so the
response confirms nothing a caller guessed.

The body is copied straight through: a large attachment is never held whole in
the backend or in the login proxy in front of it. It is served as
`application/octet-stream` with an attachment disposition and `nosniff`, so a
crafted message can never render in the origin that serves the API.

## Smoke check

```sh
smoketest -host mail.example.com -jmap -jmap-user u1@example.com -jmap-pass secret
```

Four checks:

1. an anonymous request is refused with `401`;
2. an authenticated one returns a session resource carrying `capabilities`;
3. a batch of two `Core/echo` calls runs, the second reading the first's result
   through a back-reference;
4. a body one byte over `jmap_max_size_request` is refused by the login layer
   with a `limit` problem;
5. `Mailbox/get` returns a mailbox carrying the `inbox` role, with unique ids
   and every `parentId` naming a mailbox in the same response;
6. `Mailbox/query` filtered by `role:inbox` matches exactly one mailbox, says
   `canCalculateChanges: false`, and a back-referenced `Mailbox/get` in the same
   batch resolves to that mailbox;
7. `Email/query` finds an id, a back-referenced `Email/get` reads it, and the
   blob it names downloads as a non-empty `application/octet-stream`;
8. a download for another account's blob is refused with `404`.

Check 7 needs at least one message in the account.

Check 4 sends `-jmap-max-size-request` + 1 bytes; pass the deployment's own
value if it differs from the 10M default.
